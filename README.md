# PrivateEvents

**PrivateEvents** is an Eventbrite basic mockup. It allows users to create, edit and delete events, then manage user signups. Every user can attend several events and can remove their own attendance. The user will find a page to manage events they created and that they want to attend. All events are separated between upcoming and past events. 

This project is part of a Ruby on Rails course by theodinproject.com. Available at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events
